To run the program, you need to install Eclipse first, and then download EMF, ATL and GMF.
(note: GMF is graphical modeling framework. Although it is optional for the project, it makes the model costruction process easy. )

To execute the transformation code in each diagram folder, you need to edit the run configuration.
Right click the atl file, run as->run configuration, select the corresponding ecore file (not ecore diagram) for your metamodels. 
Then select a source model, and copy and paste the path of source model to the target model, and make some change (rename the file name) on the path.
